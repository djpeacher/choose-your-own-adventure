        <p>
          You wake up in a cold sweat, dazed and confused. After a few moments
          you try to sit up, but realize you canâ€™t move. Your arms and legs are
          strapped down.
        </p>
        <p>
          You attempt to wiggle free, but quickly stop when you hear a monstrous
          noise coming from outside the room...and it's getting closer. Is
          anyone around to help you, or will you have to fend for yourself?
        </p>
        <hr />
        <button _="install TurnPage(p: #p2)">
          If you attempt to free yourself, turn to page 2.
        </button>
        <button _="install TurnPage(p: #p3)">
          If you call for help, turn to page 3.

      <section id="p2">
        <h1>2</h1>
        <p>
          You pull at your restraints, but are unable to get free. Another roar
          fills the room and this time the room begins to shake wildly. It
          shakes so wildly that the gurney you are on falls over and your
          restraints break loose.
        </p>
        <p>
          The roaring and shaking subsides, allowing you to stand and take in
          the room around you. It's hard to tell thanks to all the flickering
          lights, but it appears you are in some kind of dilapidated medical
          room.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can't hear the roaring anymore. Do you investigate the room or
          immediately head for the exit.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <button _="install TurnPage(p: #p4)">
          If you investigate the room, turn to page 4.
        </button>
        <button _="install TurnPage(p: #p5)">
          If you leave the room, turn to page 5.
